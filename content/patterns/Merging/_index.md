Once the final product of a feature branch has been achieved, the next thing to do is to merge it into the development 
branch so that it can be added to any existing features.  
Before the branch is merged, it is best practice to create a pull request for it to reduce the risk of errors occurring 
due to conflicts between the development branch and the edited version of the code within the feature branch.
